# Milestone-3

## Created by: Jose M, Bailey Franklin, Nolan Wells, and Stanley Jackson


## Functions
This app allows the user to login or register for our red robin menu app and add items to their bag.

Every item on our menu has the price and description of the item.

## Inspiration
We created this project because we wanted to see how far we have come as developers. We thought it would be interesting if we could make a mock restaurant app that is used in bigger companies.

## Technologies
We used multiple extensions such as react-bootstrap, react, express, mongoose, mongoDB, axios, cors, jwt, and bcrypt.

## Issues or Unfinished
We did not have any major issues. We wanted to add a feature to view the users account, a reservation tab, and a menu button when the bag is empty.
